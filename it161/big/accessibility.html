             <h3>Digital Accessibility: Crucial For A Global Future Of Successful Sustainable Growth</h3>

            <h4>“The power of the Web is in its universality.  Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” —Tim Berners-Lee</h4>
            
<p>The essential tenet of Web Accessibility maintains that all interested users should be able to enjoy equal access to the content and functionality of a website.</p>  

<p>The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has acutely shown us just how crucial the world’s digital connectivity is to human survival especially in older, disabled and marginalized communities around the world.  The UN reported in 2018 more than half of the ~ 8 billion people worldwide have internet access for the first time. That number will continue to grow at a fast rate.(UN News)  Despite increasing technological access to the internet, many people still face hardship due to limited web accessibility. A large proportion of all active internet users, worldwide, have physical and/or situational disabilities, and varying degrees of restrictive access to bandwidths and speed (United Nations).</p>

<p>The web community’s internationally recognized w3c organization continues to push the boundaries of accessibility compliance beyond web content to include mobile and web applications as well. There are increasing numbers of international &amp; US compliance laws that regard and use these protocol guidelines as the gold standard for the industry (w3.org), (audioeye.com).</p>

<p>While legal requirements and testing for accessibility compliance are becoming more mainstream and are crucial from a business protection point of view, I strongly believe in Tim Berners-Lee’s vision that sound website development should keep the foundational concept of universal access in the forefront of its design.	</p> 
<p>Many websites today still lack the basic accessibility requirements for successful user experience by many people on the disability spectrum.  Arielle Pardes notes “There are around 7 million people with a visual disability in the United States, according to the National Federation of the Blind…One study by an accessibility software company this August found that 70 percent of the websites it surveyed, ranging from e-commerce to news to government services, contain “accessibility blocks,” or quirks in the design that make them unreadable with assistive technology. Another accessibility report analyzing the top million homepages on the web estimates that just 1 percent meet the most widely used accessibility standards. People who use screen readers are regularly confronted with readouts like “unlabeled button” or “image1.jpg” in place of the descriptive information they need to navigate. (Pardes)”</p>

<p>Building accessibility-compliant websites and digital media applications now is the best way to future-proof your business.  The “IoT - Internet of Things” is here to stay.  We must all do our part to ensure that it is open, fair and available to everyone (Ashton 1999, as cited by Norman).</p>
