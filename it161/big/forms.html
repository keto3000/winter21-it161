             <h2 class="subheader">Web Forms</h2>
             <h3>Web Forms— ‘Landing the Mothership…’</h3>
<p>T. Maxwell, from Forbes Agency Council states it well, “I always tell our clients that they need to think about their website as the mother ship — it’s the most important piece of your digital marketing assets. You work so hard and spend so much money to drive quality leads to your website; you can’t fumble when you get to the goal line. You've worked way too hard (Maxwell).”</p>
 
<p>Effective digital marketing increases brand name recognition and generates qualified leads for your website.  Visitors to your website have a goal— they want to learn about your brand, its products, services, etc.  Clean, sharp design, interesting text content, crisp graphic and easy-to-use webforms all contribute to a successful user-friendly experience.  Web forms are one of the most and important types of interactions for users of your site.  They offer a readily efficient way for you to track online leads, learn about potential customer interests, buying habits and help to establish client relationships.</p>  
 
<p>Visually pleasing, straightforward forms work the best.  Correct coding structure can ensure that your forms are user-friendly and discoverable by assistive technologies and browser plugins making them much more accessible to a wider audience.  Web forms are highly flexible code.  The specific information being sought should always determine the type and style of forms you use.  Forms can be text boxes, radio buttons, drop down menus, etc. and can also depend upon the type of product/services offered, your customer base needs &amp; design format considerations.  “Many small businesses' contact forms don't match the look and feel of the site they set up. Either the color scheme is off or it seems out of place because something has changed, like the font. To avoid this, opt for forms you can fully customize to ensure your visitors get a streamlined experience (Krasny).”</p>
 
<p>Worldwide online purchasing has steadily risen over the last decade.  Saheli Roy Choudbury of CNBC observes that the percent increase of shoppers online has been driven still further by the coronavirus pandemic limitations on physical in-store shopping and the need for social distancing (Choudhury).  In 2021, over 2 billion people worldwide are expected to buy goods and services online, up from 1.5 billion global digital buyers in 2016 (Coppola).</p>

<p>Marketing and advertising get potential customers to visit your website.  Intuitive, user-friendly webforms allow you to initiate, engage, establish and grow meaningful client relationships!</p>
